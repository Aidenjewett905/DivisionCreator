Division Adder Instructions
Java:
* Download and use java to run the program

1. Run the .bat file, ensuring you have the JDK installed to your computer

The Program:
1. Type in the exact name of the division template, and include the quotations around it (remember that code is case and space sensitive)
2. Add The name order of the first division being added
   1. Name order is the number attached to the division (I.E. starting at 2 and creating 3 divisions will create the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th divisions of whatever chosen template)
3. Include the amount of experience that all the created units will have (Uses percentages, from 0.0 to 1.0)
4. Input the province ID where the division is located (this creates the division)
   1. After inputting a province ID, the program will ask for the next division’s province ID, creating another division
   2. Once you have created all the divisions of this template and exp level that you want, enter any negative number and the program will stop creating divisions
5. The file units.txt will have been created in the folder where your .jar file is located, and the code that you need to copy-paste will be located in the file
   1. Creating more units will overwrite the already existing units.txt file, and any text in that file will be removed
